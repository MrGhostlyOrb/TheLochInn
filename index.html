				<h3>
					About Us and Our History
				</h3>
				<p>
					The Loch Inn stands imposingly on the site of a scottish battle ground, an emblematic 19th-century building in
					the neoclassical style which is a landmark in the city of Inverness. Built on the orders of a family of the Scottish 
					bourgeoisie, it was sold in the middle of the 20th Century to the Cotton Producers Guild which established its 
					headquarters there with the aim of housing the highest possible number of cotton-producing bodies and services.

					Finally, at the initiative of a group of hotel promoters in Scotland, the building commenced an intense refurbishment 
					process which culminated in January 2015 to create the beautiful Loch Inn. The refurbishment project has taken great 
					care to maintain and recover all the original elements of the building. Acclaimed interior designer Lázaro Rosa-Violán 
					was commissioned with the project and has done a marvellous job, reflecting a contemporary and sophisticated style 
					which at the same time incorporates all the functionalities needed to assure the luxury level of service and comfort that 
					our guests deserve.

					The original elements of the building have been conserved, such as the imposing marble staircase, delicate parquet and 
					boiserie embellishing ceilings, floors and walls in some of the rooms. Also the famous spiral staircase built in 1957, 
					the main feature of which is that it is not supported on the floor below, but is suspended from the metal frame of the 
					upper floor, to give a light and airy aspect. At the same time, all the facilities of the building have been completely replaced, 
					resulting in a distinguished setting full of history, yet modern and comfortable at the same time.
