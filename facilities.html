					<p>The Loch Inn makes a unique and spectacular 
					resurant venue for special events and occasions. 
					We can host foraml or informal canapé receptions,
					small music events, formal dinners and amazing 
					wedding receptions. Inspired by the traditional 
					idea of a social club and providing the city with 
					a new eating experience, the restaurant is the 
					brainchild of two best mates, entrepreneur Felix 
					Rehberg and chef Francis Woolf. The food on offer 
					is all about sharing, with a seasonal small plates 
					menu showcasing Francis’ background in both street 
					food and fine dining. Everything about The Loch Inn 
					is artisan, from the decor - designed by Atelier 
					Grove, to the wine list - by Rupert Taylor, and 
					of course the food - innovative, intelligent cooking. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

					<p>Our library at The Loch Inn is a curated 
					collection of sources of information and similar 
					resources, selected by experts 
					and made accessible to anyone for reference or 
					borrowing. It provides physical 
					or digital access to material, or both. Our library's collection can 
					include books, periodicals, 
					newspapers, manuscripts, films, maps, prints, documents, microform, 
					CDs, cassettes, videotapes, 
					DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, e-books, audiobooks, databases, and other formats. 
					Our Library ranges widely 
					in size up to millions of items. Our library is increasingly being 
					redefined as a place to get 
					unrestricted access to information in many formats and from many 
					sources. We are extending services 
					beyond the physical walls of a building, by providing material 
					accessible by electronic means, and 
					by providing the assistance of librarians in navigating and analyzing 
					very large amounts of information 
					with a variety of digital resources. --------------------------------------------------------</p>

					<p>The Loch Inn's Bar is a cafe-bar in central Inverness. We have filled our bar with good food, top drinks,  
marvellous music and general chilled-outness. We’re happy for you to enjoy The Loch Inn’s Bar in a range 
of different ways,  whether it be with a coffee, glass of wine, tasty meal, or cheeky nibbles we’re really 
quite flexible. We like to make Sunday’s special as well by offering a fantastic Sunday Breakfast menu 
(served from 10.00 – 6.00) and a classic afternoon film (screened in the back room) along with the usual 
selection of great coffee, good papers to peruse and general loveliness. We’re very excited about our menu! 
There are plenty of breakfast and brunch options like the vegan spicy avocado on sourdough with sundried 
tomatoes and dukkah. For lunch you could try the black pepper tofu with peppers, coriander and vegetable 
braised rice (which ticks all the gluten-free, dairy-free and vegan boxes!) or perhaps the local flat 
iron steak served with chimichurri.</p>

					<p>At The Loch Inn, Our lounges are often filled with complimentary amenities such as premium food and snacks, 
fully stocked bars, modern shower facilities, fast WiFi, plentiful power outlets and secure business centers. 
Get More For Your Money and Enjoy all-inclusive amenities inside the lounge instead of purchasing them individually 
for a higher cost in the terminal. Be productive and reserve a quiet space to get work done, charge your devices, 
and make use of the fast WiFi. Regardless of whether you are traveling for business or leisure, lounge access can 
help you make the most of your Inverness experience. Treat the Family by Booking a lounge with Kids Rooms, providing 
a safe place for them to play and release energy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

					<p>A thick bed of grass is contoured by huge hedges and bushes. A pond's built in the center of the garden, a paradise 
for frogs and fish alike. The rows of flowers are slightly overgrown, but look otherwise in great shape; they're 
like a cloud of color. The hedges and bushes reach 1.2m/4ft high, but this is deliberate, as they grow far bigger 
in the wild. Various stepping stones mark the best spots, directing visitors around in a natural way. Plants, 
grass, and roots slightly disrupt the pristine look as they hungrily search for even more pieces of land to expand to.
The pond is for all intents and purposes the center piece of this garden, and therefore the most appealing part. 
The rows of flowers shouldn't be ignored, and the hedges and bushes have no hard time getting their share of the 
attention, but the rest will just always be eclipsed by the pond.</p>
